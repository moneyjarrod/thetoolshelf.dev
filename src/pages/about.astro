    <h1>About ToolShelf</h1>

    <p>
      ToolShelf is a hand-curated directory of AI integration tools. We started with MCP servers
      because the ecosystem is flooded with options and nobody is doing honest reviews.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes this different</h2>
    <p>
      Every server listed here was installed and tested by a human developer. Not scraped from
      GitHub. Not summarized from READMEs. Not generated by AI. We test in real clients, write
      honest pros <em>and</em> cons, and provide config you can actually paste and use.
    </p>

    <h2>Who curates this</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf is maintained by J-Dub, a developer who builds with MCP servers daily.
      The reviews come from actual experience — not research, not theory, not marketing.
    </p>

    <h2>How we make money</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf uses contextual ads and affiliate links to tools we genuinely recommend.
      Affiliate relationships never influence our verdicts. If a server earns a "Skip" rating,
      it stays "Skip" regardless of any partnership.
