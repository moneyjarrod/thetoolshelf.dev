    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 22, 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      ToolShelf ("we," "us," or "our") operates thetoolshelf.dev. This page explains what data
      we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
    </p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf does not require accounts, logins, or personal information. We do not collect
      your name, email address, or any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily
      contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We may use privacy-respecting analytics to understand how visitors use the site — such as
      which pages are visited and how long people stay. This data is aggregated and anonymous.
      We do not track individual users across the web.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf may display advertisements served by Google AdSense or other third-party ad
      networks. These services may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on
      your prior visits to this and other websites. You can opt out of personalized advertising
      by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" rel="noopener">Google's Ad Settings</a>
      or <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" rel="noopener">the DAA opt-out page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Affiliate links</h2>
    <p>
      Some listings contain affiliate links to third-party products and services. When you click
      an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.
      Affiliate links are clearly disclosed on the page where they appear. These relationships
      never influence our review verdicts.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf itself does not set cookies. However, third-party services embedded on this site —
      including ad networks and analytics providers — may set cookies in your browser. You can
      manage or disable cookies through your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h2>External links</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf links to third-party websites including GitHub repositories, documentation pages,
      and product sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.
      We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ToolShelf is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an
      updated date. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
